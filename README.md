1) I Created this the webpage using html5, bootstrap, javascript, YUI, Angular js, CSS

2) I used bootstrap to have a responsive page , which will look aesthetically pleasing and also will help lessen time to position divs and forms, imgs etc

3) I used angular js  in order retrieve flickr api  by using JSONP and http angular service. I Mainly used angular to show that I understand angular frame work, I could have done this by using vanilla js or jquery 


4) Finally the hardest but favorite part  was YUI library simply because I havenâ€™t used YUI before, it forced me to spend many hours to figure out how YUI works and gain that new knowledge, therefor  I am forever grateful to this test .  Even thou my Pop up container using YUI is not very aesthetically please looking, I still learned to use a whole new library of js.
